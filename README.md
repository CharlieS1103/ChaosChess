# ChaosChess
## Technologies used:
### Colyseus:
Framework used for matchmaking, build with express

### React: 
Used for the entirety of the frontend

## Purpose of this project:

Aside from being fun, this project was basically to get a feel for developing websites that run both a frontend and backend, as well as learn some new frameworks and skills. I also enjoy chess so having a place to implement whatever chess variants I can think of felt like a cool idea.
Although it definitely needs polishing I think this will be a fun project to look back on.

#### Disclaimer:
This project has so many security vulnerabilitys you don't even want to know.
